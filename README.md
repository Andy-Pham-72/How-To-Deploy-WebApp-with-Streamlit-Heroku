# :computer: How To Deploy A Simple WebApp with Streamlit Heroku :computer:

This was one of my mini lectures when I created for the students to have a quick and intuitive tutorial of how to create a simple webapp with Streamlit and Heroku.

I also have a html file to lead the beginner through step by step very detailed and straightforward via this: [link](https://github.com/Andy-Pham-72/How_To_Deploy_WebApp_with_Streamlit_Heroku/blob/master/Deploy%20WebApp%20with%20Streamlit%20on%20Heroku%20Steps.html)

I encourage people take a look at the Streamlit [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html) before creating our own WebApp.
